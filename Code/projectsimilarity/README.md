# What is it about?

The base code was implemented by @manraf [](https://github.com/manraf) and computes project similarities of Github projects.
 
	* The project uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
	* [GHTorrent](http://ghtorrent.org/) for querying the data. This method uses SSH tunneling towards MySQL as explained [here](http://ghtorrent.org/mysql.html).
